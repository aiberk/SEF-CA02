## Instructions:

Develop a plan for your website, including the layout, design, and content. Consider the target audience and the main goals of the website (e.g., to encourage membership sign-ups, promote events, or showcase facilities).
Use html, css/bootstrap, and javascript to create your front-end. Make sure to create a responsive webiste that looks great on desktop and mobile devices. Use Node.js or Express.js for the back-end. You can require external modules to add extra functionalities to your application.

**Create the necessary pages and content for your website, including:**

- Home Page: Introduce Brandeis's sports complex and highlight its unique features, such as its location, facilities, and programs.
- About Us: Provide background information on the sports complex, such as its history, mission, and values.
- Facilities: List the facilities available at the sports complex, such as a gym, pool, tennis courts, and basketball courts. Include photos and descriptions of each facility.
- Programs: Provide information on the different programs and classes offered at the sports complex, such as fitness classes, swim lessons, and youth sports leagues. Include schedules and pricing information.
- Events: List upcoming events at the sports complex, such as tournaments, races, and charity events. Include photos and descriptions of past events.
- Membership: Provide information on the different membership options available at the sports complex, along with pricing and benefits. Include a sign-up form or link to an online booking system.
- Contact Us: Provide contact information for the sports complex, including address, phone number, email, and social media accounts. Include a contact form that visitors can use to send a message.

Use multimedia (such as photos, videos, and graphics) to enhance the user experience and showcase the sports complex.

Make sure your website is easy to navigate, with clear calls-to-action that encourage visitors to sign up for memberships or register for events.
Test your website to ensure it is responsive.

**Note:** You don't have to simulate the Brandeis Sport Complex exactly as it is in Brandeis Sport Center. For example, if there are a lot of services, facilities and programs then you can simulate at least three important ones if you think is hard to cover all.
